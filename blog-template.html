#  How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It made it simpler to get the wireframe done faster. You're able bounce ideas off of eachother and can add things you might not think of. A pair makes it way faster to code an HTML page because you guys can split the load in half and go twice as fast.

#  Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yea it makes it way easier to code when you have an idea of what you want your website to look like. It's also useful to see how your planned website will be on the usability side.


# What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

A good wireframe is simple yet intricate enough so you can see what you want your site to look like but don't need to have all the images and formatting ready. You need to build a house first before you can paint it and that's what we did with our wireframe.

# What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

  I just used all the elements that I knew from previous assingments.
