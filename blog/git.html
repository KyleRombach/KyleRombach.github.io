        Hello everyone, I'm going to give you a little insight on what version control, Git, and Github are. First let's dig into what version control is.Version control is an extremely useful software for people in the coding world. I'm sure most of you out there have written some sort of paper on a word proccessor before. So you know that when you write your paper, you're gonna want to save the progess and you'll make one save file. It's super convient having your work in one spot but there's some problems that will arise. If you were to edit your paper and then save it, you would change the save or have to make another file which can be tedious having multiple files to keep track of. If like most people, you just overwrite your previous save then you'll be left with just the new updated work. Well what happens if you want to go over your changes or dont like your new save? You are pretty limted in your options to solve any of these problems. This is where version control comes into play and why it's very important to use for coding. Version control will keep your main save and allow you to branch off from it. Say I'm writing a piece of code and want to then go edit it. Well I'll go make a new branch, then work on it there and if I like the new additions I can add it to the master save. When I do add a new piece of code and save it, I'll be able to see what changes I've made and go back to a previous save if I end up not liking it. So not only can I make it so I work on the code without changing it, others can make their own branch to be able to edit the code as well. This ability to simultaneously work on a code and not effect eachothers work is extremely helpful in making sure a code can be written fast and correct.

        Okay great, now we have a basic understanding of version control but how do I get it for my computer. Git is a commonly used version control software. When using git you have to do certain commands to get from editing the code to actually changing it. Git will show you what you are working on and if you have anything added that's ready to be committed. Once you've gotten your files added and committed, git will keep a log of what has been done. You can use that log to go back and see what commits you've done and you can also delete any if you don't like the result. You must know that Git only does the changes to your personal computer and you need to add another step if you want to share them online.

        So now you've gotten your code ready and you want to share it with others. A website called GitHub allows you to do this. GitHub is basically a software equivalent of Dropbox. For those of you who don't know what Dropbox is, it's a program that allows people to store files online and let people access them. With the use of GitHub, people can upload and download work easily from one another.  So in order to use GitHub you'll have to have an account and make a repository for your work to be saved. Once you have a repository you can start pushing your work from git on your computer to the online repository. Here people can send their commits for them to be reviewed and eventually added to the master save.
    </p>

      Hopefully with all this information, you now have a better understanding of version control, Git and GitHub. These are all very important things to know and use in everyday life for coding.
