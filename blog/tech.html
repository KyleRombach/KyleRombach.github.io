Many of us have used the internet but how does it work exactly? Well the internet is just like a telephone network and our computer's send information to other computers through a common connection. All the internet does is move computerized information from one place to another. Like the postal service it doesn't matter why people send stuff or what they send just that it needs a way to be sent and received.
</p>
<p>
It's like the postal service where letters are passed from one place to another, and it doesn't matter what it contains or who it's from. All thing's on the internet are treated equally so no type of information is handled differently when being sent.
</p>
<p>
So how does it get sent from place to another? Well if you guys remember dial-up, it would directly use your phone line so you can either talk on the phone or use the internet. Obviously this isn't a very effective way to use the internet. This is called circuit switching. Now we use packet switching which is much more effective. What packet switching does, is to break the data into small parts and then send it to the destination and allow each piece to get seperate routes. This allows you to not have to be dedicated to one connection because your information is going through several ways instead of just the one connection. This is just some basic information about the internet and how it works.
