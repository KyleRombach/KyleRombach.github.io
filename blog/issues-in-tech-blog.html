<p>The other day I was showing my friend my website from my phone and noticed that it wasn't set up right for the smaller screen. Things were overlapping and it just looked kinda messy. It made me start to think what I could do to make my website look better but it also made me wonder what other issues might come up with my future designs and issues some people might have other than just a layout problem.</p>
<p> While looking up accessibility options, it made me realize how some simple tweaks, can make a huge difference in making sure everyone can understand what you are showing them.I'm sure you guys have seen images with text that was hard to read. You need to make sure you get the contrast between your image and text at a good ratio so that it's easier to see the difference. No one wants to strain their eyes trying to decipher words in a image.
</p>
<p> Color and contrast is not only an issue with images but with the text and your background. If your background color and text color are too similiar or your text color is too light it's gonna be hard for people to read. You can also use highlighting options so you know what's selected.
</p>
<p>
  While color is really useful for a lot of things to help people interact with your website, you can still have issues for people who are color blind. If you have an error that is only changed in color, how will they know what's wrong? You need to use other tools such as making it bold or perhaps it changes font.
</p>
<p>
  There's still a lot more I can learn about how to make sure I sufficiently code everything to be as accessible as possible. We all love the internet and apps, so we should strive to make it as easy to use for everyone out there. I know when I start editing my webpage more I'm gonna make a concious effor to change anything I have wrong now to make it a better experience.
