* -What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I didn't use borders or padding much but I used margins a fair amount. I learned how to make it easier to adjust the margins between a href links by using specific selectors for them.


* - What did you learn about CSS positioning?

That I still have a lot more to learn. I was able to get everything position fairly easily by doing fixed but then I can't always get my page to flow properly. I need to learn more about how to use the other positions to make my website even better.

* -What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

Changing font, color, size, and stuff along that nature was fairly easy. I had a fair amount of difficulty aligning everything. Eventually it started to get easier but I still don't feel confident in my ability.

* - What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

Once you get your template in CSS down it makes it much easier to change my html pages. I liked how I just had to change a few specific things depending on the page and then the rest of the styling was already done.
